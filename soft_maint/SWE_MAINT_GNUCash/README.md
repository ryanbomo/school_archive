# SWE_MAINT_GNUCash

This is the README.md for our GNUCash class project repository.  This document will contain an outline of what our project is, what we are working on, our deliverables and who is on our team.

## Goal

The team's goal is to apply software maintenance methodologies learned in class (SWE 4520/5510) to the GNUCash project. Our team will research bugs and feature requests on Bugzilla and then individually work on those bugs, using the team for support along the way.

The format of this project is to very loosely serve as an introduction to barebones AGILE principles. Using methods from the Scrum paradigm, we will meet after each class to go over what we are working on, what our roadblocks are, and where we plan to go. We will also be working towards producing work products on a weekly basis, using the following schedule (loosely):

- Week 1 (Sept 25th)  - Bug Proposal
- Week 2 (Oct 2nd)  - Root Cause Analysis for chosen bug
- Week 3 (Oct 9th) - Road map for planned design, development, testing and integration for fix
- Week 6 (Oct 30th)  - Final Fix Iteration
- Week 7 (Nov 6th) - Peer Reviews/Testing

   Our work products will be kept here, as with any other documents or files that the team members see as necessary.
